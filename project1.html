<header>A User-Friendly App for Students to Get Involved</header>

<br>

<h1>Case Study</h1>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> A simpler approach to encouraging students to participate in the school community. This app will introduce students to the clubs and communities that are accessible to them in a friendly and participatory manner. For instance, when you click on clubs, a list of all the clubs with information on their goals, hours, membership count, etc., is displayed. Developing a club feature is an even more crucial component towards this application. This feature demonstrates that students are not limited to the clubs that are offered; instead, they can form their own club that focuses on interests that they have that other students could also have, fostering a more inclusive and cohesive community. It's a more enjoyable and social approach to engage with the community at your school. In addition to joining clubs, you'll be able to view their posts and tweets, which will keep you informed and current.
</p>
<br>
<P><strong>Main Issue:</strong> This application aims to increase student involvement and encourage them to join clubs. Many students have trouble obtaining this information, locating an office where they may learn more, or perhaps they are simply too afraid to ask questions. Additionally, it allows students to view all of their options in one convenient location rather than having to look elsewhere for this information and decide which choice best meets their preferences.

    <h4><b>Aria More</b></h4>
    <p class="title">Aspiring Engineer</p>
    <p> Aria More is a 19-year-old young woman currently studying to get her Associates Degree in science but she enjoys doing sports such as volleyball and track in her free time. She was born and raised in Manhattan, New York City, and decided to take a gap year after graduating from High School. Furthermore, she is entering college as a freshman and is quite anxious since she hasn’t been in a school environment for quite some time, and is unsure of what to expect.</p>
    <p><b>Motivations:</b> John is driven by his passion for technology and his desire to make a positive impact on the world through engineering.</p>

<br>
<P><strong>Users and Audiences:</strong> Our target audience is Freshmen, even though the application is designed for all students at BMCC college. Freshmen in college sometimes feel overburdened by the task of acclimating to their new surroundings, learning about their classes, and getting to know the campus. They can save time and avoid the headache of locating these clubs and determining what is available to them by using this app. Aria Winters is an incoming sophomore who, despite no longer being a freshman, is a transfer student. As such, she will experience all of the same things a freshmen experiences when they visit a new college for the first time. She can quickly find what she's interested in on the app and see if the club aligns with her schedule.

<p><strong>User Flow</strong></p>

<P><strong>Processes:</strong>
  This application was designed through a great deal of trial and error. Since you want people to download and utilize the app, there were a lot of inquiries about what features should be included and what sets it apart from other applications. I came to the conclusion that it was crucial for students to be able to browse through all of the clubs that are offered, learn about them, and get a small idea of what joining that group would entail. This is the rationale behind the postings page; it's akin to that portion of social media that's popular among the general public these days. With a page of their own, each club makes it simple for students to join. The Discover page appears fairly different from what I have displayed on my user testing page because I also discovered that many of the designs I had in mind didn't quite work as well together. Another crucial component of the software was the accessibility bar at the bottom. It was challenging but enjoyable for me to fit all I wanted in the app within the three icons.

<br>
<P><strong>Overall Style:</strong>
  Essentially, I wanted to go for a more social media style application. Rather than it just being an application that bombards you with a bunch of textual information you won’t want to read. I wanted something easy to use, modern and fun looking.
  I went with the school’s colors using that shade of blue for the overall color scheme of the application and stuck to primarily only using Roboto in different font weight and sizes for any type included. I used another font named Chela One for the logo as I wanted something fun and friendly looking to introduce the app.  
</P>


<br>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong>
I arranged everything into the three distinct pages of the application after deciding exactly what I wanted to include to make sure each was distinct and contained all the information required, and then I started designing. All of the clubs at BMCC are listed on the Discover page, and if you'd like, you may even form your own club by clicking on the appropriate button. You may view the feed of the clubs you presently belong to on the "Your Communities" page, allowing you to remain informed about any new posts or tweets that may have been made. The You page is the last one, where you can view the clubs you are a member of as well as the date of your membership. You can alter your biography and profile photo on the "you" tab, which also provides you with information on how other users see your profile on the app. The biggest challenge was ensuring that all the details of a club you were interested in were conveniently located in one location and weren't just text thrown in your face. The discovery page expertly addresses this issue by presenting you in a more contemporary, friendly, and social manner.
