I'm Sierra, and I'm a nineteen year old aspiring software developer and artist. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, playing video games, coding and drawing. Drawing has always been something I've loved and enjoyed doing, even as a young child in elementary school. As I became older, I realized that this passion piqued my attention so much that I wanted to pursue it as a career. I had the opportunity to attend a high school where, in addition to teaching me how to draw, they also introduced me to other forms of art, such as the art of coding and the world of technology.  I'm versatile in the sense that I don't just stick to one thing yet I enjoy branching out, learning, creating and combining the arts and technology.I consider myself adaptable because I don't limit myself to just one passion that I find enjoyable yet I find ways to combine them and further my knowledge and experience.

              I attended Highschool in September 2018 and graduated in June 2022.  Throughout my experience, I was formally introduced to and studied in both majors Illustration and Graphic Design. I was fortunate enough to create in a professional studio setting daily, meet multiple professionals in the industry, be a part of amazing internships, and witness not only my own growth as an artist but everyone around me.
